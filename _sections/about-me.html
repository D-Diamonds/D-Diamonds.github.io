<p>I began my adventure into the world of programming at the age of 14, now 18. Throughout high school, I spent my time developing the school's perspective on the computer science world. With CyberPatriot compeititions to weekly computer club meeetings, the program sprouted in my school. Now I will be attending Georgia Institute of Technology to further my computer science education and bring positive change to the world.</p>
