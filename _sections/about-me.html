<p>I began my adventure into the world of programming at the age of 14, now 18.
    Throughout high school, I spent my time developing the school's perspective and capacity to participate in the computer science world.
    From CyberPatriot competitions to weekly computer club meetings, the computer science division sprouted in my school and with my leadership.
    Now I attend Georgia Institute of Technology to further my computer science education and bring positive change to the world.</p>
