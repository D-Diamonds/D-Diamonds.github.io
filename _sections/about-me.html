<p>I began my adventure into the world of programming at the age of 14, now 18. Throughout high school, I spent my time developing the school's perspective on
    the computer science world. From CyberPatriot competitions to weekly computer club meetings, the computer science division has sprouted in my school. Now I
    attend Georgia Institute of Technology to further my computer science education and bring positive change to the world.</p>
