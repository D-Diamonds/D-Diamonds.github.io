<p>I began my adventure into the world of programming at the age of 14, now 19.
    Throughout high school, I spent my time developing the school's perspective and capacity to participate in the
    computer science world.
    Now I attend Georgia Institute of Technology to further my computer science education and bring positive change to
    the world. I focus on Intelligence (AI) and Information Internetworks (Information Management). </p>
