<div id="message"><p>Dear Sarah,
    <br/>Happy 2-month anniversary, although it feels like almost a year in terms of memories with you. From our first date at The Yard, our actual first date
    having sushi, I have enjoyed constant happiness and memorable moments with you. Our trip to the lake house is unforgettable, driving around on Jet Skiâ€™s
    while breaking our backs and obviously staying up watching Survivor. When I wake up, I smile thinking of you and our future. When I go to sleep, I feel
    heart warmed by all our memories. All I want to do is keep making more memories with you. I cannot wait to visit you soon! I miss you a lot!
    <br/>Love,
    <br/>Joshua
    <br/>
    <br/>Below is a gallery of our memories with more to add every day
